# nibblonian

This is a REST-like HTTP API for iRODS written on top of jargon-core. 

All commands respond to POST requests, unless otherwise noted. A successful call will have a 200 status code, while an error will have either a 400, 404, or 500 status code. You must set the "Content-Type" header to "application/json" for any POST requests that upload JSON. Failing to do so will result in an error message.

All commands take a "user" query string parameter. This is the iRODS user that is requesting the operation. The service runs as an iRODS superuser and performs actions on the behalf of the user specified in the query string.

Also worth noting is that I've pretty-printed the JSON from the response bodies, but they aren't actually returned like that when you make a call.

## Deploying nibblonian

Nibblonian is packaged as a war file, so it deploys like pretty much other war file in existence. Dump the war file in servlet container, make sure it explodes, configure it, restart the servlet container.

## Configuring the nibblonian war file

The path to the config file is WEB-INF/classes/nibblonian.properties inside the nibblonian war file. It contains options for configuring the connection to iRODS and log4j. The default config file looks like this:

    # Jargon-related configuration

    nibblonian.irods.host=127.0.0.1
    nibblonian.irods.port=1247
    nibblonian.irods.user=rods
    nibblonian.irods.password=rods
    nibblonian.irods.home=/tempZone/home/rods/
    nibblonian.irods.zone=tempZone
    nibblonian.irods.defaultResource=

There is also a log4j config file located at WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties inside the nibblonian war file. It's a normal log4j properties file that looks like this by default.

    # Jargon-related configuration
    log4j.rootLogger=WARN, A, B

    log4j.appender.B=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
    log4j.appender.B.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
    log4j.appender.B.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{MM-dd@HH:mm:ss} %-5p (%13F:%L) %3x - %m%n

    log4j.appender.A=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
    log4j.appender.A.File=nibblonian.log
    log4j.appender.A.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
    log4j.appender.A.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{MM-dd@HH:mm:ss} %-5p (%13F:%L) %3x - %m%n

The iRODS configuration should look fairly similar to other systems that interact with iRODS. defaultResource is mentioned on the off-chance that we need it, but it's fine to leave it blank.

The log4j configuration section is just a bog-standard log4j configuration. It configures two loggers by default, one that goes to stdout and another that goes to a log file. You might want to disable the ConsoleAppender, but leaving it in shouldn't hurt anything.

## File Upload Via URL

Curl command:

    curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"dest" : "/tempZone/home/rods/footest2002.txt", "address" : "http://www.google.com/"}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/urlupload?user=rods

Response:

    {
        "path":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/footest2002.txt",
        "status":"success",
        "action":"url-upload"
    }

## File Upload

File uploads are the odd command out. All parameters are passed as form fields. See the curl command below for more details.

Curl command:

    curl -F file=@LICENSE.txt -F dest=/tempZone/home/rods/arg.txt -F user=rods http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/upload

Response:

    {
        "path":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/arg.txt",
        "status":"success",
        "action":"file-upload"
    }

## File Download

Curl command:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/download?user=rods&path=/tempZone/home/rods/arg.txt

The file should get downloaded. The "Content-Disposition" header will be included in all download responses. By default, it will include the "attachment;" value, which can be disabled by placing the "attachment=0" query parameter into the URL. An example would look like the following:

    curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/download?user=rods&path=/tempZone/home/rods/arg.txt&attachment=0'

Setting "attachment" to 1 will re-add the attachment value to the Content-Disposition header field. 

## Directory Creation

Curl command:

    curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"path" : "/tempZone/home/rods/test3"}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/directory/create

The response body:

    {
       "action":"create",
       "path":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/test3",
       "status":"success"
    }

## Directory List (Non-Recursive)

Curl command:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/directory?user=rods&includefiles=1

If the "includefiles" is 0 or left out of the params, then the files section will be empty.
If you want to list a directory other than rods' home directory, then include a URL encoded
path parameter, like so:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/directory?user=rods&includefiles=1&path=/iplant/home/rods/ugh

Response for the first curl command:

    {
       "action":"list",
       "path":{
          "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods",
          "label":"rods",

             {
                "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/fakedir2",
                "label":"fakedir2"
             },
             {
                "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/foo1",
                "label":"foo1"
             },
             {
                "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/foobarbaz",
                "label":"foobarbaz"
             },
             {
                "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/src",
                "label":"src"
             },

                "id":"\/tempZone\/home\/rods\/target",
                "label":"target"
             },
             {

    {
        "action" : "preview",
        "preview" : "Copyright (c) 2011, The Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of \nThe University of Arizona\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nDeveloped by: iPlant Collaborative as a collaboration between\nparticipants at BIO5 at The University of Arizona (the primary hosting\ninstitution), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, The University of Texas at\nAustin, and individual contributors.

    }

## File manifest

Curl command:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/manifest?user=johnw&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt

Response:

    {
        "action":"manifest",
        "rawcontents":"file\/download?user=johnw&path=\/iplant\/home\/johnw\/LICENSE.txt"
    }

OR

    {
        "action":"manifest",
        "preview":"file\/preview?user=johnw&path=\/iplant\/home\/johnw\/LICENSE.txt"
    }

If the raw content is too large a preview will be sent instead. Additionally, if the file's name ends with .png, then the field containing the URL path to the download will be called "png". If the file's name ends with ".pdf", then the field will be named "pdf". Additionally, if the file is a PDF, then the query parameter "attachment=0" is added to the download path, which allows browsers to use their default PDF viewer, if they have one.


## File/Directory existence:

The /exists endpoint allows the caller to check for the existence of a set of files. The following is an example call to the exists endpoint:

Curl command:

    curl -H "Content-type:application/json" -d '{"paths" : ["/iplant/home/wregglej/pom.xml", "/iplant/home/wregglej/pom.xml2"]}' 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/exists?user=wregglej'

Response:

    {
        "action":"exists",
        "status":"success",
        "paths":{
            "/iplant/home/wregglej/pom.xml2":false,
            "/iplant/home/wregglej/pom.xml":false
        }
    }


### File and Directory  Metadata:

The following commands allow the caller to set attributes on files in iRODS. iRODS attributes take the form of Attribute Value Unit triples associated with directories and files. Files/directories cannot have multiple AVUs with the same attribute name, so repeated POSTings of an AVU with the same attribute name will overwrite the old value.

## Setting File and Directory  Metadata

Note the single-quotes around the request URL in the curl command. To associate metadata with a directory, change the path portion of the request url to '/directory/metadata' (minus the quotes) and make sure that the path indicated in the query string is a directory instead of a file.

Curl command:

    curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"attr" : "avu_name", "value" : "avu_value", "unit" : "avu_unit"}' 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/metadata?user=johnw&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt'

Response:

    {"action":"set-metadata","status":"success","path":"\/iplant\/home\/johnw\/LICENSE.txt","user":"johnw"}


## Getting File and Directory  Metadata

Note the single-quotes around the request URL in the curl command. Also note that the metadata returned in the "metadata" field is in a list, since this command returns all of the metadata associated with a file or directory.

To get metadata associated with directories, change the path portion of the URL to '/directory/metadata' and make sure that the path listed in the query portion of the URL is actually a directory.

Curl command:

    curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/metadata?user=johnw&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt'

Response:

    {
        "action": "get-metadata",
        "status": "success",
        "metadata": [
            {
                 "attr": "avu_name",
                 "value": "avu_value",
                 "unit": "avu_unit"
            }
        ]
    }
man
## Deleting File and Directory Metadata

As before, note the single-quotes around the request URLs in the curl command. To get the directory version of the command, replace the path portion of the URL with '/directory/metadata' and make sure that the path indicated in the query portion of the URL points to a directory.

Curl command:

    curl -X DELETE 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/metadata?user=johnw&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt&attr=avu_name'

Response:

    {
        "action":"delete-metadata",
        "status":"success",
        "path":"\/iplant\/home\/johnw\/LICENSE.txt",
        "user":"johnw"
    }

## Setting a Tree URL for a File

Multiple tree URLs can be associated with a file. To support this, multiple POSTs of tree-urls for the same file will append the URLs to the list stored in iRODS. Multiple tree URLs can be associated with a file in a single request. You still need to place a URL in a list even if you're only associated one URL with a file.

Something to note is that we're not checking to make sure that the strings in the 'tree-urls' list are actually URLs. This is intentional and will hopefully make migrating to a token based tree retrieval a little simpler.

Curl command:

    curl -d '{"tree-urls" : [{"label" : "google", "url" : "http://www.google.com"}, {"label" : "yahoo", "url" : "http://www.yahoo.com"}]}' 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/tree-urls?user=johnw&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt'

Response:

    {
        "action":"set-tree-urls",
        "status":"success",
        "path":"\/iplant\/home\/johnw\/LICENSE.txt",
        "user":"johnw"
    }


## Getting a Tree URL for a File.

Curl command:

    curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/file/tree-urls?user=rods&path=/iplant/home/johnw/LICENSE.txt'

Response:

    [
        {
            "label" : "google",
            "url" : "http://www.google.com"
        },
        {
            "label" : "yahoo",
            "url" : "http://www.yahoo.com"
        }
    ]

## Deleting a Tree URL.

See the instructions for deleting metadata associated with a file. The attribute name for the tree URLs is 'tree-urls'.
